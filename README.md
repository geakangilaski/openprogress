# Open Progress

Map election promises from coalition agreements/action plans to real debates in parliamentary bodies to show real progress of governance based on actual data. This is the fork of [Guardians of Governance](http://www.praxis.ee/tood/valitsemise-valvurid/) to make the process (in large part) automatic.

* Detect/formalise keywords of coalition agreements/action plans of government for automatic search.
* Natural language analysis of discussions in parliament (passing legal acts, information inquiries by opposition, press conferences, results of voting etc).
* Visualise results using progress bars and display/highlight parts of text that the results are based on.

Details:

* Use data from Estonian parliament [demo API](https://aavik.riigikogu.ee/) and/or [data dumps](https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/60#issuecomment-294106882).
* Use [Vabamorf](https://github.com/estnltk/pyvabamorf) for basic natural language processing.
* Need data analysts, data visualisers plus some UX/scripting.

This is first iteration to hack our democracy to open it up for more reasonable and measurable election promises.

The initial project was developed during 12h at [Demokratiahack](https://www.sitra.fi/tapahtumat/demokratiahack/).
