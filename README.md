This project was developed during 12h at [Demokratiahack](https://www.sitra.fi/tapahtumat/demokratiahack/).

We took coalition agreements from Estonian parliament and gave our try to formalise the objectives set with keywords and logical operators and map given promises to actual discussions in parliament. The goal was to display the results as different progress bars based on occurrences of words in various parliamentary contexts. During hackathon we:

* Indexed the parliamentary discussions for search and language analysis;
* Proposed a format to describe objectives presented in coalition agreements;
* Tried out different ways to map promises to discussions (including law proposals, inquiries by opposition, press conferences etc).
